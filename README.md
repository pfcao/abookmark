## Concepts

### node

A node is a bookmark or a bookmark folder in Chromium.

### home folder node

The Home folder is the default starting folder of Abookmark.

Abookmark uses the 'Other bookmarks/favorites' as home folder by default.

### inbox folder node

Newly created bookmarks will be put into the subfolders of inbox folder. If there is no inbox folder appoited, home folder will be used as inbox.

### top folder

Top folder is a folder for shortcuts. You can put anything you like into it.

Abookmark uses the 'Bookmarks/Favorites bar' as top folder by default.

### onetab

A 'tab' in onetab is nothing but a bookmark node in Abookmark.

Save [one tab] / [all the tabs] / [tabs on the right] to inbox folder and close these tabs.

In app page, you can reopen these tabs/bookmarks by click the titles. But if you click the urls on the right side, the node will be removed at the same time. This is what we called 'restore'.

Abookmark is built with performance in mind. You can save thousands of tabs easily. Your data's safety is guaranteed by your native bookmark system.

### labels/tags

User tags should start with '#' and contain no other symbols, but may have '-' or '\_'.

All other symbols are reserved by Abookmark.

'@' tags are for all kinds of links. Generally they are created automatically by Abookmark.

'#!' tags are for macros.

'$' tags are reserved for system usage.

<!-- ### id tag:

format: '@' + 'folder id' + ':' + 'anything'
eg: @100:books

The 'id' may be omitted. Then id tag becomes: '@:' + 'node_name'
eg: @:books

The 'node_name' can be any part of that node's title. When you click a id tag, AsNote will search out all titles matched the 'node_name'. -->

### Trash

When in 'Trash' mode, all deleted nodes will be marked as trash and moved into trash folder. You can restore them by 'Normalize' function.

You should select a trash folder node to enable trash mode. Any folder may be appoited as trash folder, even outside of working folder.

### Recycle

'Recycle' engine may reuse these 'trash' nodes when you create new nodes.

'Recycle' is designd to reuse node ids. Generally this is not necessary if you do not know what it is. So it is disabled by default.

Trash folder reserves at least 50 (100 after v0.6) nodes from recycling by default.

### Fold

'Fold' creates a new folder besides the last selected node and moves all selected nodes into that folder.

Suppose you want to move several nodes into a folder.

### Merge

'Merge' unfolds all other selected folders(if they are folders) and moves them into(or beside) the last selected node.

'Merge' is designed to merge several folders but it is also useful for bookmarks.

### link picking

Suppose you are viewing a page contains many links. You want to mark some of the links and read them another day. This is what we called "link picking".

After switched to Picking mode, any links clicked with 'Ctrl' (by default) in that page will be bookmarked and the openning of new tabs will be terminated. You can click any other tab to exit Picking mode.

<!-- ### link sailing

Generally a bookmark is a note of a 'static' url. But sometimes this is not the best choice. For example, I am surfing from bookmark of site/page1, then I go to site/page2, site/page3... Now I want my bookmark to point to site/page3. Abookmark can do this automatically. This is the 'link sailing'.

When in sailing mode, Abookmark will always update the bookmark to the latest page of that site you are surfing. That page will inherit the former notes and tags.

When a tab is in link sailing mode, there will be a 'S' shown in the extention icon badge.

How to trigger 'link sailing'?

- Click a bookmark in Abookmark tagged with #!sailing.
- Click a bookmark in Abookmark whose parent folder tagged with #!sailing.
- Click a bookmark in Abookmark with alt/shift according to your settings.
- Trigger 'toggle sail mode' command in any web page bookmarked.

How to exit 'link sailing'?

- Go to another site.
- Close that tab.
- Trigger 'toggle sail mode' command in that web page. -->

### filter:

The 'filter' only effects the first level nodes in main panel. It does not change the database, but only rearranges the view dynamicaly.

You can use filter to do something as 'search in current folder'.

You can use 'regular expression' in the filter, just as in the 'search'.

### top bar:

Top bar is similar to chrome/edge's bookmark bar, but it is more 'spreaded'.

You can load the top bar by its keyboard shortcut. If the top bar 'trigger' is active (in settings), you can load the top bar by click on the top of the left edge in a typical web page.

A 'typical web page' is a normal 'http/https' web page.

### spread view:

Spread view is the backend of top bar menu, and it works in app page as well. It supports basic dragging / dropping.

Left click on the 'arrows' in a folder (or drag a node upon the right arrow) to load its spread view.

Since v0.21, a icon is a checkbox at the same time. You can use Shift to select successive nodes.

Alt + Click the icons in spread menu to reveal the corresponding node.

### search:

The search box supports javascript regular expressions (regex). We add some keywords for search, and they can be generated by search panel.

### data editor:

With data editor you can edit the data of bookmarks directly in JSON formate. You can use your favorite text editor for further editing.

In the 'Edit' mode, a node is updated by its id if the corresponding bookmark can be found. Nodes without 'id' field are treated as new bookmarks. A node with '-id' field instead of 'id' field will be removed.

All nodes are treated as new bookmarks if you are in the 'Create' mode.

## FAQ

### Why does Abookmark need permission of "Site access On all sites"?

This is necessary only if you want to show sticky notes in web pages automatically (and to load the top bar trigger since v0.8). This does not affect any other features.

### May I rename the folders created by Abookmark?

Of course.

Since bookmark importing can not restore the 'create date', we suggest you keep the 'date' in the folder name, but this is not enforced.

### How to import/export data?

Abookmark is just bookmarks.
You can use the native bookmark manager to import/export all the data.

### May I transfer my data from onetab?

Yes.

You can import onetab's export data into bookmarks directly. But that data has no folder or date information. We write a little exporter to parse and download the full data as bookmarks:

[onetab-to-bookmarks.js](onetab-to-bookmarks.js)

### What's the benefits if I switch from onetab?

- Sync across browsers. You can even view the saved 'tabs' ( as bookmarks) on your mobile phone.
- Transform smoothly from 'saved tabs' to bookmarks at any time.
- As bookmarks, you can see (from the 'star' in the address bar) whether that page has been saved before. You can remove saved pages directly by clicking that bookmark icon (or our app icon, with trash support).
- Backup without losing data structures.
- Fast.
- Trash.

### Is Abookmark running in all web pages in the background?

No.

Abookmark does not inject anything into any web page unless it has notes to show or you evoke it explicitly (by shortcuts or button clicks).

Since v0.8, there is an option (inactive by default) to load a top bar trigger into web pages. This trigger is no more than a button.

Some other in page bookmark extention will load the bookmarks into every page beforehand, so they can boot up immediately when you click. This is OK if it works well for you. But this is not the philosophy of Abookmark. It runs very fast only because it is extremely optimized.
